Tales From The Hood turns 25. Jordan Gass-Poore’, host of Pod of Madness, turns 30. 

In the first episode of Pod of Madness, Jordan interviews Rusty Cundieff, the co-writer/co-director of the upcoming “Tales From The Hood 3: The Mouths of Babes and Demons,” according to the movie’s script (thanks, Rusty, for checking). 

Her interview with Rusty touches on the cultural relevance of the original “Tales from the Hood,” 25 years later, as well as, the origins of the series and the upcoming third movie, which will be available on DVD sometime in October and air on the Syfy channel on Oct. 6 (but, you know, life is mad, so that air date may change. Keep an eye out for any updates on podofmadness.com).
